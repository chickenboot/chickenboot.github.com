Well it has been an interesting six months. It's surprisingly difficult and time consuming starting a business from scratch wouldn't you know? The previous blogs were all well and good, but in the end I made the mistake I think many of us techies do, and got my priorities a bit backwards.

I also thought I could design a full product-showcasing website from scratch, but I was mistaken. At least for now, it's definitely on my list of skills to learn soon! 

Now that we have our products sorted, our plan sorted, several customers who have tested out our production process and all those other tiny things out of the way, we have turned our attention to the website. Rather than wait for decades for me to learn the design process, we've outsourced the design to our very talented friends at [Moving](http://www.movingstudio.co.uk/).

So it's time for me to dust off my skills and remind myself (thankfully I wrote a few blogs on it!) how this all works, and describe this new (more effective I hope) way of doing things.

Oh and I'm sticking with Foundation 3 even though Foundation 5 was released today! I'm an old school enterprise man at heart, and I don't do upgrades until they're at least a year past their support end-of-life!
